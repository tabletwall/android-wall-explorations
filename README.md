Project Description
===

Some of our ideas for this project are as follows:

* Develop a distributed computing system capable of handling intercommunication between a "wall" of tablets
* Have a central server to handle mediation between tablets
* Each tablet is to draw a canvas, able to handle basic drawing and dragging objects between screens
* Setup an intuitive mounting array to display a number of tablets
