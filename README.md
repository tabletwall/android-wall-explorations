==Android Wall==

This project is being developed by a team of computer science students at Loyola University for Pervasive Systems Research Seminar. To learn more, please reference our [https://trello.com/b/atKDaeNx/library-of-research-resources Trello] board.

===Project Description===

Some of our ideas for this project are as follows:
* Develop a distributed computing system capable of handling intercommunication between a "wall" of tablets
* Have a central server to handle mediation between tablets
* Each tablet is to draw a canvas, able to handle basic drawing and dragging objects between screens
* Setup an intuitive mounting array to display a number of tablets
